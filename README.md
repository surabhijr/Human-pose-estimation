# Enhancing Human Pose Estimation and Scoring Using ANN
Developed a Deep Learning Model using MediaPipe as a pose estimator to analyze human body positions and detect perfect Jump and Squat exercises for sports analytics. Furthermore, I implemented Classification and Regression techniques to provide exercise scores. The model achieved an impressive 92% precision rate, a testament to its accuracy and consistent learning patterns. This project involved extensive training on a large dataset, demonstrating my commitment to achieving high-quality results in machine learning and sports analytics.

# USAGE
This Code can be executed using the google collab environment by specifying the path for the dataset appropriately.

# Data
The Dataset used for this project is a series of videos where the Jump and Squat actions are performed by almost 11 children or a dataset to predict a different action with same logic can also be used.

# Methods
1. Time series neural network
2. LSTM
3. CNN+RNN
4. Mediapipe
