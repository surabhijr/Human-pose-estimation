Developed a Deep Learning Model using MediaPipe as a pose estimator to analyze human body positions and detect perfect Jump and Squat exercises for sports analytics. Furthermore, I implemented Classification and Regression techniques to provide exercise scores. The model achieved an impressive 92% precision rate, a testament to its accuracy and consistent learning patterns. This project involved extensive training on a large dataset, demonstrating my commitment to achieving high-quality results in machine learning and sports analytics.
